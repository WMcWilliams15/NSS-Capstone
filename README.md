Executive Summary
Is there a correlation between carbon emissions and the current climate change? I want to show the correlation, or lack of, between recent carbon emissions and the current change in climate. I will start with climatology data and look for trends and record dates at the start and end of trend. Next I will look for trends in the data for carbon emissions and see if there is a correlation between the dates for the climatology data. There are several data sets that I will have to explore to get an accurate analysis. It will take a lot of work, however; I am passionate about being a good Stewart of this planet. I think the biggest challenge of this analysis will be the research it will take to make sense of the trends I find. 
Motivation
This is an issue that effects everyone on the planet. On a more personal level, this
 will affect my children the worst. I am really into sciences involving the universe. From what I can tell, the consensus is that this planet is extremely rare. I feel that we should act accordingly, and its disturbing that we don’t. 

Data Question(s)
Is there a correlation between carbon emissions and the current climate change? What are the leading causes for carbon emissions? What country is most responsible for carbon emissions? 
This is a link to an article with an interesting approach to use data to explain the mechanics of how carbon emissions impact climate science.

Known Issues and Challenges
I have an elementary understanding of climatology, so it will take a good deal of research just to understand the numbers that I am looking at. I don’t want to give a science lesson in climatology or how the atmosphere traps co2, so the story telling part of my analysis still needs to be worked out. Otherwise, the data seems to be pretty clean and easy to work with.
