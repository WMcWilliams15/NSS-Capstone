# Executive Summary
	Is there a correlation between carbon emissions and the current climate change? This is an issue that effects everyone on the planet. On a more personal level, this will affect our children the worst. I am really into sciences involving the universe. From what I can tell, the consensus is that this planet is extremely rare. I feel that we should act accordingly, and its disturbing that we donâ€™t.  I want to show the correlation, or lack of, between recent carbon emissions and the current change in climate. I will start with climatology data and look for trends and record dates at the start and end of any trends. Next I will look for trends in the data for carbon emissions and see if there is a correlation between the dates for the climatology data.
