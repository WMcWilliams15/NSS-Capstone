# USE OF NOAA ESRL DATA,,,
#,,,
# These data are made freely available to the public and the,,,
# scientific community in the belief that their wide dissemination,,,
# will lead to greater understanding and new scientific insights.,,,
# The availability of these data does not constitute publication,,,
# of the data.  NOAA relies on the ethics and integrity of the user to,,,
# ensure that ESRL receives fair credit for their work.  If the data,,,
# are obtained for potential use in a publication or presentation,,,
# ESRL should be informed at the outset of the nature of this work.,,,
# If the ESRL data are essential to the work, or if an important,,
# result or conclusion depends on the ESRL data, co-authorship,,
# may be appropriate.  This should be discussed at an early stage in,,,
# the work.  Manuscripts using the ESRL data should be sent to ESRL,,,
# for review before they are submitted for publication so we can,,,
# ensure that the quality and limitations of the data are accurately,,,
# represented.,,,

# RECIPROCITY,,,
#,,,
# Use of these data implies an agreement to reciprocate.,,,
# Laboratories making similar measurements agree to make their,,,
# own data available to the general public and to the scientific,,,
# community in an equally complete and easily accessible form.,,,
# Modelers are encouraged to make available to the community,,,
# upon request, their own tools used in the interpretation,,
# of the ESRL data, namely well documented model code, transport,
# fields, and additional information necessary for other,,
# scientists to repeat the work and to run modified versions.,,,
# Model availability includes collaborative support for new,,,
# users of the models.,,,

# Data from March 1958 through April 1974 have been obtained by C. David Keeling,,,
# of the Scripps Institution of Oceanography (SIO) and were obtained from the,,,
# Scripps website (scrippsco2.ucsd.edu).,,,
#,,,
# The estimated uncertainty in the annual mean is the standard deviation,,,
# of the differences of annual mean values determined independently by,,,
# NOAA/ESRL and the Scripps Institution of Oceanography.,,,
#,,,
# NOTE: In general, the data presented for the last year are subject to change,,
# depending on recalibration of the reference gas mixtures used, and other quality,,
# control procedures. Occasionally, earlier years may also be changed for the same,,
# reasons.  Usually these changes are minor.,,,
